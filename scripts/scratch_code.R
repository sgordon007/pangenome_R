# If you named your missing sex data "unknown" or "missing" use that string instead of "" above.

# Tells ggplot what data you're going to be plotting with
ggplot(data = surveys_complete)
# But we haven't told it yet how to build the plot, so no plot is created

# Next we need to tell ggplot what variables we want to assign to each axis of our plot
ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length))
# But it still doesn't make a plot!!! (Technically it makes a plot but there's no data plotted)

# We need to tell ggplot what type of plot we want
ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +  geom_point()
# the geom_point() function tells ggplot what type of plot (scatterplot), and the "geom" stands for geometric

The + symbol in ggplot can be used to add information on subsequent lines, similar to how we used %>% earlier


# Assign plot to a variable
surveys_plot <- ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length))
# Draw the plot
surveys_plot + geom_point()
surveys_plot + geom_hex()


# Challenge (optional)
# Scatter plots can be useful exploratory tools for small datasets. For data sets with large numbers of observations, such as the surveys_complete data set, overplotting of points can be a limitation of scatter plots. One strategy for handling such settings is to use hexagonal binning of observations. The plot space is tessellated into hexagons. Each hexagon is assigned a color based on the number of observations that fall within its boundaries. To use hexagonal binning with ggplot2, first install the R package hexbin from CRAN:
#   install.packages("hexbin")
# Then use the geom_hex() function:
#   surveys_plot + geom_hex()
# What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of a hexagonal bin plot compared to a scatter plot? Examine the above scatter plot and compare it with the hexagonal bin plot that you created.


ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) + geom_hex()


What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of a hexagonal bin plot compared to a scatter plot? Examine the above scatter plot and compare it with the hexagonal bin plot that you created.

ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +    geom_point()

# Make points transparent by setting the alpha argument (measurement of transparency). 
# This is set within the geom_point function because it applies to the points you're drawing.
# Alpha can be a value from 0 to 1, we hoose 0.1 is a value that is pretty transparent (so closer to 0 than 1), color

ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +    geom_point(alpha = 0.1)

Similarly if we want to change the colors of the points, we put that in the geom_point function.

ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +    geom_point(alpha = 0.1, color = "blue")

But we can change the color of the dots for each species by doing: 
  
  ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1, aes(color=species_id))

# Here we have set an aesthetic within the geom_point call that applies a different color to each group.

How do you know what order to put the arguments in? 
If you explicitly specify the arguments (eg "alpha = 0.1"), then the arguments can be in any order. 
Functions often have default arguments that they are expecting in a certain order, as long as the inputs you provide in the positions are compatible formats (eg numerical if numerical is expected), then these arguments 

ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +    geom_boxplot()

ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +    geom_boxplot(alpha = 0) +    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3, color = "tomato")
